# PART 1: BUSINESS FUNDAMENTALS

## Chapter 1: What Is a Business, Really?

A business is a system that:
1. **Solves a problem** for specific people
2. **Charges money** for that solution
3. **Makes more money than it spends** (profit)

That's it. Everything else is details.

Your app solves this problem:
> "Healthcare providers waste hours on paper intake forms, manual data entry, and writing clinical summaries. Patients hate filling out clipboards in waiting rooms."

Your solution:
> "Digital intake forms with AI-powered clinical summaries that save providers 15-30 minutes per patient."

## Chapter 2: Why Software Businesses Are Special

Software has unique economics that make it potentially very profitable:

### The Magic of Software Economics

| Traditional Business | Software Business |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Sell a product once | Sell access monthly (recurring) |
| Each unit costs money to make | Each additional user costs almost nothing |
| Limited by physical inventory | Unlimited digital copies |
| Local customers | Global customers |
| Need employees to deliver | Software delivers itself 24/7 |

### Key Concept: Marginal Cost

**Marginal cost** = What it costs to serve ONE more customer

- Restaurant: ~$10 per meal (food, labor)
- Consulting: ~$100/hour (your time)
- Software: ~$0.01 (server costs)

This is why software companies can be worth billions. Once you build it, serving 1,000 customers costs almost the same as serving 10.

---

## Chapter 3: The SaaS Business Model

SaaS = **S**oftware **a**s **a** **S**ervice

Instead of selling software once for $500, you rent access for $50/month.

### Why SaaS Wins

| One-Time Sale | Subscription (SaaS) |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Customer pays $500 once | Customer pays $50/month |
| Revenue: $500 | Revenue: $600/year, $3,000 over 5 years |
| Must find new customers constantly | Same customers pay every month |
| No ongoing relationship | Ongoing relationship = can upsell |
| Customer may use outdated version | Everyone on latest version |

### The SaaS Metrics That Matter

**MRR** = Monthly Recurring Revenue
- How much money comes in every month from subscriptions
- Example: 100 customers × $100/month = $10,000 MRR

**ARR** = Annual Recurring Revenue
- MRR × 12
- Example: $10,000 MRR = $120,000 ARR

**Churn** = Percentage of customers who cancel each month
- If you have 100 customers and 5 cancel = 5% monthly churn
- CRITICAL: High churn kills SaaS businesses

**LTV** = Lifetime Value
- How much money you make from a customer before they cancel
- Example: $100/month × 24 months average = $2,400 LTV

**CAC** = Customer Acquisition Cost
- How much money you spend to get ONE new customer
- Example: $5,000 in ads → 10 new customers = $500 CAC

**The Golden Ratio: LTV:CAC**
- Healthy SaaS: LTV is 3x or more than CAC
- Example: $2,400 LTV ÷ $500 CAC = 4.8x (excellent!)
- If LTV < CAC, you lose money on every customer (death spiral)

---

## Chapter 4: B2B vs B2C

**B2B** = Business to Business (selling to companies)
**B2C** = Business to Consumer (selling to individuals)

IntakeAI is **B2B** - you're selling to healthcare practices, not patients.

### Why B2B is Better for IntakeAI

| B2C (Consumers) | B2B (Businesses) |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Pay $5-20/month | Pay $100-1000+/month |
| Cancel on a whim | Sticky (switching is painful) |
| Emotional decisions | Logical ROI decisions |
| Millions needed for scale | Hundreds can build big business |
| Support nightmares | Fewer, higher-value relationships |
| App Store takes 30% | Direct billing, 0% fee |

### The B2B Healthcare Buyer

Who actually buys software at a medical practice?

**Small Practice (1-5 doctors):**
- Decision maker: The doctor (owner)
- Timeline: 1-4 weeks
- Budget: $100-500/month
- Concerns: Does it save ME time? Is it easy?

**Medium Practice (5-20 doctors):**
- Decision maker: Practice manager or administrator
- Timeline: 1-3 months
- Budget: $500-2,000/month
- Concerns: ROI, staff training, integration

**Large Practice/Hospital (20+ doctors):**
- Decision maker: Committee (IT, compliance, operations)
- Timeline: 3-12 months
- Budget: $2,000-50,000+/month
- Concerns: Security, compliance, vendor stability

**Your initial target: Small practices (1-5 doctors)**

Why? Faster sales, direct access to decision maker, can close deals yourself.

# PART 2: YOUR MARKET

## Chapter 5: The Healthcare Software Market

### Market Size (TAM, SAM, SOM)

**TAM** = Total Addressable Market
- All the money spent on patient intake software globally
- ~$3 billion/year

**SAM** = Serviceable Addressable Market
- The portion you could realistically reach
- US small-to-medium practices = ~$500 million/year

**SOM** = Serviceable Obtainable Market
- What you can realistically capture in 3-5 years
- 1-5% of SAM = $5-25 million/year

### Why These Numbers Matter

When you talk to investors or partners, they'll ask about market size.

- Too small (< $100M): "Not worth our time"
- Too big (you claim): "They don't understand their market"
- Just right: "Big enough to build a great business"

$500M+ SAM is excellent for a venture-backed startup or a very successful bootstrap.

## Chapter 6: Your Competition

You're not the first to think of digital patient intake. Know your enemies.

### Direct Competitors

| Competitor | Pricing | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Phreesia** | $200-500/month | Market leader, integrations | Expensive, complex |
| **Intakeq** | $50-200/month | Popular, good UX | No AI, limited features |
| **Klara** | $100-300/month | Communication focus | Not intake-focused |
| **SimplePractice** | $29-99/month | Popular with therapists | Niche, limited intake |
| **Jotform Health** | $34-99/month | Cheap, flexible | Generic, no AI |
| **DrChrono** | $200+/month | Full EHR | Overkill for intake |

### Your Competitive Advantage

What do you have that they don't?

1. **AI-Powered Summaries** - No competitor does this well
2. **Red Flag Detection** - Automated urgent symptom alerts
3. **Modern Mobile App** - Most competitors are web-only
4. **Simpler Pricing** - Not trying to be a full EHR

### Positioning Statement

> "IntakeAI is the only patient intake solution that uses AI to automatically generate clinical summaries and detect urgent symptoms, saving providers 15-30 minutes per patient encounter."

---

## Chapter 7: Your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

Not all customers are equal. Define who you're building for.

### Primary ICP: Small Private Practice

**Demographics:**
- 1-5 physicians
- Primary care, internal medicine, or specialty
- Private practice (not hospital-employed)
- US-based
- Tech-comfortable (age 35-55)

**Psychographics:**
- Frustrated with administrative burden
- Values efficiency and patient experience
- Willing to try new technology
- Makes their own purchasing decisions

**Pain Points:**
- Spending 10+ minutes per patient on paperwork
- Patients arriving late due to long forms
- Handwriting interpretation errors
- No time to write detailed notes
- Missing important symptoms in rushed visits

**Current Solutions:**
- Paper forms (nightmare)
- Generic PDF forms
- Basic EHR intake (clunky)
- Nothing (winging it)

### Secondary ICP: Specialty Practices

- Dermatology, Orthopedics, Cardiology
- Higher patient volume
- More complex intake needs
- Higher willingness to pay

### Anti-ICP: Who NOT to Sell To

- Large hospital systems (too slow, too complex)
- Practices with <6 months in business (unstable)
- Doctors who are anti-technology (will never be happy)
- Practices in financial distress (will churn)

---

# PART 3: PRICING STRATEGY

## Chapter 8: The Psychology of Pricing

Pricing is not math. It's psychology.

### Pricing Principles

**1. Price on Value, Not Cost**
- Your server costs $100/month
- But you save a doctor 20 hours/month
- Doctor's time worth $200/hour
- You're creating $4,000 in value
- Charge 10% of value = $400/month (not $100)

**2. Anchor High**
- If you show $500 first, $200 feels cheap
- If you show $100 first, $200 feels expensive
- Always show enterprise pricing first on your website

**3. Use Specific Numbers**
- $397 feels more calculated than $400
- $397 suggests "we figured out exactly what this is worth"

**4. Remove Dollar Signs in Premium Contexts**
- "397" feels less like spending money than "$397"
- High-end restaurants use this trick

**5. Yearly Discounts**
- Monthly: $99/month ($1,188/year)
- Yearly: $79/month ($948/year) - "Save $240!"
- You get cash upfront, they feel smart

# PART 4: COSTS & UNIT ECONOMICS

## Chapter 11: What It Actually Costs

### Startup Costs (Before Launch)

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Development (your time) | $0-100,000 | Opportunity cost or contractor cost |
| Legal (LLC, contracts) | $1,000-3,000 | Can DIY some, lawyer for HIPAA |
| HIPAA compliance setup | $5,000-15,000 | Consultant + implementation |
| Security audit | $5,000-10,000 | Penetration testing |
| Apple Developer account | $99/year | Required for App Store |
| Domain + branding | $200-1,000 | Logo, website |
| Initial hosting setup | $500-1,000 | First month setup |

**Total startup: $12,000 - $130,000**

(Lower end if you do everything yourself, higher end with contractors and full compliance)

### Monthly Operating Costs

#### At 0-50 Customers

| Item | Monthly Cost |
|------|--------------|
| Hosting (HIPAA-compliant) | $500-800 |
| Database (managed Postgres) | $100-200 |
| Gemini API | $50-200 |
| Sentry (error tracking) | $26 |
| Email service (SendGrid) | $20-50 |
| Monitoring (Datadog) | $50 |
| SSL/CDN | $0-20 |
| Support tools (Intercom) | $0-74 |
| Accounting software | $30 |
| **Total** | **$776-1,448** |

#### At 50-200 Customers

| Item | Monthly Cost |
|------|--------------|
| Hosting (scaled) | $1,000-2,000 |
| Database (larger instance) | $300-500 |
| Gemini API (higher usage) | $200-500 |
| Support (more tickets) | $150-300 |
| Other tools | $200-300 |
| Part-time support person | $1,500-2,500 |
| **Total** | **$3,350-6,100** |

#### At 200-500 Customers

| Item | Monthly Cost |
|------|--------------|
| Infrastructure | $3,000-5,000 |
| Support team (2 people) | $6,000-8,000 |
| Sales person | $5,000-8,000 |
| Marketing | $2,000-5,000 |
| Tools & software | $500-1,000 |
| **Total** | **$16,500-27,000** |

### Cost Per Customer

| Scale | Customers | Monthly Cost | Cost/Customer |
|-------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Early | 25 | $1,000 | $40 |
| Growing | 100 | $4,000 | $40 |
| Scaling | 300 | $20,000 | $67 |

**Key insight:** Costs grow slower than revenue. At 300 customers paying $250/month average, you're making $75,000/month and spending $20,000. That's **$55,000/month profit** (73% margin).

---

## Chapter 12: Unit Economics Deep Dive

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Formula:** LTV = ARPU × Customer Lifetime

**ARPU** (Average Revenue Per User) = $250/month = $3,000/year

**Customer Lifetime** = 1 / Monthly Churn Rate
- 5% churn = 20 months
- 3% churn = 33 months
- 2% churn = 50 months

**LTV Calculation:**
- At 5% churn: $250 × 20 = **$5,000**
- At 3% churn: $250 × 33 = **$8,250**
- At 2% churn: $250 × 50 = **$12,500**

**This is why reducing churn is so important.**

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

How much does it cost to get one customer?

**Typical channels and costs:**

| Channel | Cost per Customer | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Word of mouth | $0 | Best, but slow |
| Content marketing | $100-300 | Blog, SEO, takes time |
| Google Ads | $200-500 | Healthcare keywords expensive |
| LinkedIn Ads | $300-600 | Good for B2B |
| Cold outreach | $100-200 | Your time + tools |
| Conferences | $500-1,000 | Booth, travel, etc. |
| Referral program | $50-150 | Give discount for referrals |

**Blended CAC target: $300-500**

### LTV:CAC Ratio

| Scenario | LTV | CAC | Ratio | Verdict |
|----------|-----|-----|-------|---------|
| Bad | $2,000 | $800 | 2.5:1 | Barely surviving |
| OK | $5,000 | $500 | 10:1 | Healthy |
| Good | $8,000 | $400 | 20:1 | Excellent |
| Great | $12,000 | $300 | 40:1 | Time to scale aggressively |

**Rule of thumb:** LTV:CAC should be at least 3:1. Above 5:1 is excellent.

### Payback Period

How long until a customer pays back their acquisition cost?

**Formula:** CAC / Monthly Revenue

- $400 CAC ÷ $250/month = **1.6 months**

Under 12 months is good. Under 6 months is excellent. 1.6 months is outstanding.

**Why this matters:** Fast payback = you can reinvest quickly and grow faster.

# PART 5: GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY

## Chapter 13: Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Founder-Led Sales (Months 1-6)

**Goal:** Get your first 20 customers yourself

**Why founder-led?**
- You learn what customers actually want
- You learn their language and objections
- You learn what makes them buy
- No one sells your product better than you

**Tactics:**

1. **Warm outreach** (Week 1-4)
   - Friends/family who are doctors
   - LinkedIn connections in healthcare
   - Local doctors you know
   - Medical school classmates

2. **Cold outreach** (Week 2-8)
   - LinkedIn Sales Navigator
   - Find practice managers and physicians
   - Personalized messages (not spam)
   - Template:

   > "Hi Dr. [Name], I noticed you run a [specialty] practice in [city]. I built an app that uses AI to automatically summarize patient intakes, saving providers 15-30 min per patient. Would you be open to a 15-min demo? I'm offering founding customers 50% off for life."

3. **Landing page + waitlist** (Week 1)
   - Simple page explaining the product
   - Email signup for early access
   - Testimonials once you have them

4. **Local medical associations** (Month 2-3)
   - Join local medical societies
   - Attend meetings
   - Offer to present

### Phase 2: Repeatable Sales (Months 6-12)

**Goal:** Find a repeatable acquisition channel

**Test these channels:**

1. **Content marketing**
   - Blog posts: "How to reduce patient intake time"
   - SEO for "digital patient intake", "AI medical summary"
   - Guest posts on medical blogs

2. **Paid ads (small budget)**
   - Google Ads for high-intent keywords
   - LinkedIn ads to practice managers
   - Start with $500-1,000/month, measure ROI

3. **Referral program**
   - Give existing customers $100 credit for referrals
   - Give new customers 1 month free
   - Healthcare is relationship-driven - referrals work

4. **Partnerships**
   - EHR vendors (integration partnerships)
   - Medical billing companies
   - Practice management consultants

### Phase 3: Scale (Year 2+)

**Goal:** Grow 3-5x with systems and team

1. **Hire first salesperson**
   - They should do 3-5x your sales
   - Pay base + commission (50/50 split)
   - Give them your playbook

2. **Scale content marketing**
   - Hire writer or agency
   - Publish 2-4 posts per week
   - Build SEO moat

3. **Increase paid spend**
   - If ROI is positive, spend more
   - Test new channels
   - Optimize conversion funnels

---

## Chapter 14: Sales Process for Healthcare

### The Sales Funnel

```
Awareness → Interest → Evaluation → Decision → Purchase → Onboarding → Retention → Expansion
```

### Healthcare-Specific Sales Cycle

**Small Practice (1-5 docs):** 1-4 weeks
1. Discovery call (15 min) - understand their problems
2. Demo (30 min) - show the solution
3. Trial (7-14 days) - let them use it
4. Close (15 min) - handle objections, get payment

**Medium Practice (5-20 docs):** 1-3 months
1. Discovery with practice manager
2. Demo with physicians
3. Security/compliance review
4. Trial with limited users
5. Pricing negotiation
6. Contract signing
7. Implementation

### Common Objections and Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have intake forms" | "Absolutely. But do they write your clinical summaries and alert you to red flags? Let me show you what you're missing." |
| "It's too expensive" | "Let's calculate ROI. If you see 20 patients/day and save 10 min each, that's 3+ hours saved. What's your time worth?" |
| "Is it HIPAA compliant?" | "Yes. We have [encryption, BAAs, audit logs, etc.]. Here's our security documentation." |
| "What if the AI is wrong?" | "The AI assists—it doesn't replace your judgment. You review everything before it goes in the chart." |
| "We're too busy to switch" | "I understand. The switch takes 30 minutes, and you'll save that every day after. When would be a good time for a 30-min setup call?" |
| "Let me think about it" | "Of course. What specific concerns can I address to help with your decision?" |

### Pricing Negotiation

**Rules:**
1. Never negotiate on price—negotiate on terms
2. Offer annual prepay discount (already built in)
3. Offer extended trial if they commit to decision date
4. Never discount more than 20% without getting something (case study, referral, longer term)

**Example:**
> "I can't lower the price, but if you commit to an annual plan today, I can add 3 extra months free. That's effectively 20% off."

---

# PART 6: BUILDING THE BUSINESS

## Chapter 16: Legal & Business Structure

### Step 1: Form Your Company

**Recommended: LLC (Limited Liability Company)**

**Why LLC:**
- Separates personal and business assets
- Pass-through taxation (no double tax)
- Simple to set up ($50-500)
- Can convert to C-Corp later if needed

**Where to form:**
- Delaware (best for raising investment)
- Your home state (simplest)
- Wyoming (lowest fees, privacy)

**What you need:**
1. LLC formation (use Stripe Atlas, Clerky, or LegalZoom)
2. EIN (free from IRS)
3. Business bank account
4. Accounting software (QuickBooks, Wave)

### Step 2: Required Legal Documents

| Document | Purpose | Priority |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Terms of Service | User agreement | CRITICAL |
| Privacy Policy | Data handling (HIPAA) | CRITICAL |
| BAA Template | HIPAA requirement | CRITICAL |
| Customer Contract | Enterprise sales | HIGH |
| Employee/Contractor Agreement | Hiring | MEDIUM |
| NDA | Partnerships | LOW |

**Cost:** $2,000-5,000 for lawyer to draft healthcare-specific versions

### Step 3: Insurance

**Required for Healthcare SaaS:**

| Insurance | Coverage | Cost |
|-----------|----------|------|
| General Liability | Basic business protection | $400-600/year |
| Errors & Omissions (E&O) | Professional liability | $1,000-3,000/year |
| Cyber Liability | Data breach coverage | $1,000-2,500/year |

**Total: ~$2,500-6,000/year**

**Critical:** You NEED cyber liability insurance before handling real PHI.

**Early stage:**
- Below market salary + equity
- Equity range: 0.5-3% for early employees
- 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff

**Growth stage:**
- Market rate salary
- Smaller equity (0.1-0.5%)
- Clear career paths

## Chapter 18: Raising Money vs Bootstrapping

### Option 1: Bootstrapping

**Definition:** Building with your own money and revenue

**Pros:**
- Keep 100% ownership
- No investor pressure
- Build at your own pace
- Profitable from day 1 (survival mode)

**Cons:**
- Slower growth
- Limited resources
- Personal financial risk
- May miss market window

**Best for:**
- Healthcare SaaS (long sales cycles, steady growth)
- Solo founders or small teams
- Those who want control

### Option 2: Raising Investment

**Funding stages:**

| Stage | Amount | What For | What You Give Up |
|-------|--------|----------|------------------|
| Pre-seed | $100K-500K | MVP + first customers | 10-15% equity |
| Seed | $500K-2M | Product-market fit | 15-25% equity |
| Series A | $2-15M | Scale sales & marketing | 20-30% equity |
| Series B+ | $15M+ | Market domination | 15-25% more |

**Pros:**
- Faster growth
- Hire faster
- Survive mistakes
- Network and advice

**Cons:**
- Lose control
- Pressure to grow fast
- Board approval needed
- Must aim for big exit

**Best for:**
- Huge markets (winner-take-all)
- Capital-intensive businesses
- When speed is critical

### My Recommendation for IntakeAI

**Bootstrap to $1M ARR, then decide.**

Why:
1. Healthcare SaaS has predictable, steady growth
2. You'll have real numbers to negotiate better terms
3. You'll know if you even want to scale bigger
4. Many healthcare SaaS companies are profitable without funding

# PART 7: OPERATIONS & SCALING

## Chapter 19: Customer Success & Retention

### Why Retention is Everything

**Math:**
- 5% monthly churn = 46% annual churn (lose half your customers every year)
- 2% monthly churn = 22% annual churn (much better)
- 1% monthly churn = 11% annual churn (excellent)

**The impact:**

| Monthly Churn | Customers After 3 Years | Revenue Impact |
|---------------|------------------------|----------------|
| 5% | 16 of 100 remain | Constantly replacing lost revenue |
| 2% | 48 of 100 remain | Growing sustainably |
| 1% | 70 of 100 remain | Compounding nicely |

### Reducing Churn

**1. Nail onboarding (first 7 days)**
- Personal welcome call
- Setup assistance
- Check-in on day 3, day 7
- Goal: Get them to "aha moment" fast

**2. Track engagement**
- Who's logging in?
- Who's generating summaries?
- Who stopped using the product?
- Reach out BEFORE they cancel

**3. Build habits**
- Daily/weekly email summaries
- Red flag alerts (valuable notifications)
- Dashboard they want to check

**4. Gather feedback**
- NPS surveys quarterly
- Exit interviews for churned customers
- Feature request tracking

**5. Provide excellent support**
- Respond within hours, not days
- Go above and beyond
- Remember: small market, reputation matters

### Expansion Revenue

Don't just keep customers—grow their accounts.

**Expansion opportunities:**
- More providers added to practice
- Upgrade to higher tier
- Add-on features (premium AI models)
- Annual prepay conversion
- Additional locations

**Net Revenue Retention (NRR):**
- Formula: (Starting MRR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Starting MRR
- Target: 100%+ (even with some churn, expansion makes up for it)
- Best SaaS companies: 120-150% NRR

# PART 8: REAL TALK - HARD TRUTHS

## Chapter 21: Why Most Apps Fail

**90% of startups fail.** Here's why, and how to avoid it.

### Failure Reason #1: No One Wants It

**Symptom:** Can't get anyone to pay, even for free
**Cause:** Built what you think they need, not what they want
**Fix:** Talk to 50 doctors BEFORE building more features. Ask what problems they'd pay to solve.

### Failure Reason #2: Can't Sell It

**Symptom:** People like it but don't buy
**Cause:** Weak value proposition, wrong price, bad sales process
**Fix:** Iterate on messaging. Try different prices. Get better at sales.

### Failure Reason #3: Can't Keep Customers

**Symptom:** High churn, customers leave after 3-6 months
**Cause:** Product doesn't deliver enough value, poor support, or buggy
**Fix:** Talk to churned customers. Fix root causes. Over-invest in first 30 days.

### Failure Reason #4: Run Out of Money

**Symptom:** Burn rate exceeds revenue, runway shrinking
**Cause:** Spending too much too early, hiring too fast
**Fix:** Cut ruthlessly. Default to profitable. Only spend money that makes money.

### Failure Reason #5: Founder Burnout

**Symptom:** You're exhausted, losing motivation
**Cause:** Doing everything alone, no boundaries, no wins
**Fix:** Celebrate small wins. Take breaks. Get a co-founder or mentor.

## Chapter 22: The Honest Timeline

What it actually looks like:

**Months 1-3:** Building and preparing
- Finish MVP
- Get compliant
- Build landing page
- Start outreach

**Months 4-6:** Finding first customers
- 0-10 customers
- Lots of rejection
- Product feedback
- Constant iteration
- Revenue: $0-2,000/month

**Months 7-12:** Finding product-market fit
- 10-40 customers
- Starting to understand what works
- Refining sales process
- Revenue: $2,000-10,000/month
- Maybe break even on costs

**Year 2:** Growth
- 40-150 customers
- Repeatable sales process
- First hire
- Revenue: $10,000-40,000/month
- Profitable

**Year 3:** Scale
- 150-400 customers
- Small team (3-8 people)
- Revenue: $40,000-100,000/month
- Real business

**This is the realistic path.** Not the "built a billion-dollar company in 18 months" stories you read about.

---

## Chapter 23: Your Personal Finance

### While Building IntakeAI

**Rule #1: Have a runway**
- 6-12 months of living expenses saved
- Or keep your job and build on the side

**Rule #2: Pay yourself something**
- Even $2,000/month is better than $0
- You need to survive to succeed

**Rule #3: Don't go into debt**
- Credit cards at 24% APR will kill you
- Use savings or revenue, not loans

### When to Quit Your Job

**Conditions to go full-time:**
1. $5,000+ MRR (can cover minimum expenses)
2. OR 6+ months runway
3. AND clear path to $10,000 MRR
4. AND you're the bottleneck (need more time)

### Founder Salary Benchmarks

| Stage | Founder Salary |
|-------|---------------|
| Pre-revenue | $0-2,000/month |
| $5K MRR | $3,000-4,000/month |
| $15K MRR | $5,000-7,000/month |
| $30K MRR | $7,000-10,000/month |
| $50K+ MRR | $10,000-15,000/month |
| $100K+ MRR | Market rate |

# FINAL WORDS

## The Reality of Building a Business

Building IntakeAI into a real business will be:
- **Harder** than you expect
- **Slower** than you expect
- **More rewarding** than you expect

You will face rejection. You will doubt yourself. You will wonder if it's worth it.

**Keep going.**

The healthcare system desperately needs better software. Doctors are burning out from administrative burden. Patients deserve better experiences. Your app solves a real problem.

The question isn't whether the market exists—it does. The question is whether you'll persist long enough to find your customers and serve them well.

## Your Competitive Advantage

You have something that 99% of people don't: **you actually built the damn thing.**

Most people just talk. You built an app. That already puts you ahead.

Now take the next step: get one customer. Then ten. Then a hundred.

## My Challenge to You

**In the next 7 days:**
1. Talk to 5 doctors about their intake process
2. Form your LLC
3. Finish the critical security fixes
4. Create a landing page

**In the next 30 days:**
1. Have a working, HIPAA-compliant product
2. Get 3 beta users
3. Get your first dollar of revenue

**In the next 90 days:**
1. Have 10 paying customers
2. Be at $2,000+ MRR
3. Know your sales process

The business won't build itself. **Go.**
